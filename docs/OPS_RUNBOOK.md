## On-Call / Escalation
- **Primary:** Director agent (automated) with human sponsor on pager during trading hours.
- **Secondary:** Risk agent (auto) + human safety officer for limit breaches.
- **Tertiary:** Compliance/legal contact for regulatory escalations.

Escalation steps follow `GOVERNANCE.md` matrix; severe incidents require manual approval to resume trading.

## Standard Operating Procedures
1. **Health Check Failure**
   - Identify failing component (data API, agent, scheduler).
   - Attempt auto-retry (max 3). If unresolved, mark system as degraded and skip trading for day.
   - Log incident with root cause steps.
2. **Data Quality Alert**
   - Quarantine suspect dataset, switch to backup source.
   - Notify Quant agents to avoid impacted signals.
3. **Risk Breach**
   - Risk agent pauses new orders, Execution cancels outstanding orders, Director compiles incident report.
   - Human approval required before resuming.
4. **Compliance Veto**
   - Block trade, annotate reason, inform strategy owner.
   - Director must document remedial action or escalate for policy change.
5. **Execution Failure**
   - Retry with alternate venue/params if within guardrails.
   - On repeated failure, halt and flag for manual intervention.

## Maintenance Windows
- Weekly (Saturday 10:00-14:00 local): dependency updates, model retraining, prompt refresh.
- Monthly: backup validation, kill-switch drill, API key rotation rehearsal.

## Tooling & Automation
- APScheduler for cron-like orchestration (`run_daily_trade`, `midday_check`, `eod_closure` jobs).
- Observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana or Streamlit) for live monitoring.
- Slack/email/webhook notifications for alerts.

## Documentation & Reporting
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for material process changes.
- Store runbooks/playbooks version in `AUDIT_TRAIL`.
- Ensure on-call roster and contact info remain current.
