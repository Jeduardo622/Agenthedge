# Source Code Layout

This directory will host the autonomous hedge fund runtime:

- `data/`: ingestion pipelines and caching.
- `agents/`: specialized agent orchestrators and prompt assets.
- `execution/`: broker adapters (Alpaca paper/live).
- `infra/`: schedulers, observability, and shared utilities.

Additional modules will be added as we implement the roadmap.
